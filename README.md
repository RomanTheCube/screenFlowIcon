# screenFlowIcon
Salesforce Screen Flow Icon Selector

Simple component that allows you to specify a SLDS icon (https://www.lightningdesignsystem.com/icons/) and display that icon in your screen flow.

Accepts sizes of: xx-small, x-small, small, medium, large

*there are a few icons that simply don't display correctly, unfortunately. Not sure why but there are only a handful of them.
